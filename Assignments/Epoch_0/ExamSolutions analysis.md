## Results--Static Analysis and Triage:
- SHA256 hash of the binary - `4ce4f83fb5c267e8b88c475bde8be5a1ae08f1cf4a093c42d966ea829eaf1ec0`
- Import hash of the binary - `70af479f7b4e629c97c1ca727551f680`
- The architecture of the binary - 64 bit (Optional Header `Magic` field)
- When was it compiled - `2022-10-20T02:52`
- Is this  malware? `True` or `False` 
- If so, what kind of malware is it? Loader or Dropper
- Justify your answer or submit `N/A`
- python list of suspicious strings
	- `"UrlMkSetSessionOption"` - Sets options for the current Internet session.
	- `"DeleteUrlCacheEntryW"` - Removes the file associated with the source name from the cache, if the file exists. (loader)
	- 
- python list of suspicious imports  If none, write `[]`
- please provide a python list of IOC pairs If none, write `[]`. Here a pair is a `dict` object that contains a the type of IOC, the value, and a justification. For example: 
```python
[
	{"type": "URL", "Value": "http://evilch0nk.cf/evil.exe", "Comments": "Url where the second stage payload was likely stored"}
	, 
	{"type":"Domain", "Value":"evil.ch0nk.cf", "Comments": "Domain associated with server hosting second stage payload"}, 
	{"type": "sha256", "Value": "2edf9264d1996a8a0a21a65e9e632e527e1b7ce2ce82c6bda81db27", "Comments": "sha256 hash of ClickMe.exe. Known bad."}
	...
]
```
Note that some values might fall into multiple categories such as `"C:\malware\ch0nky.txt`.  Submit a separate IOC for each category it satisfies.  
## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
For each binary that you determine to be malicious, identify all Tactics and Techniques associated to the Binary.  You submission should be a python dictionary/JSON compatible . For example, if the binary as `ClickMe.exe`, I would expect your answer to look like this:
```python 
# Execution->[Native API, User Execution]
{
	"TA0002": {
		"Techniques":["T1106", "T1204"],
		"Comments": "Optional justification"
	}
}
```

# Threat Actor
Answer the following:
- Who is this threat actor targeting?  How did you come to this conclusion 

## Extras
### Observe Actor behavior 
### Extra IOCs
- Try and use the IOCs you found in the previous sections to find more IOCs not found in the current binaries!
- Flags...there may be some flags :-)
- Challenge: Can you find the secret C2(s)? 
- For each C2, is it custom, proprietary, or an opensource tool?

### Operator interaction
There seems to be someone on the other end of some of the malware-- perhaps even an interactive session!  Map the commands/actions performed by the operator to  MITRE ATT&CK
